# SFOSC SourceCred demo

Currently using a fork from SourceCred's master branch.
See https://github.com/Beanow/sourcecred/tree/hack/weight-overrides

## Configuration notes

The deployment SSH key will also need read-access to any repository it needs to load data from.
This because SourceCred loads over SSH not HTTP.
