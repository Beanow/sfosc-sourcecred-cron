# SFOSC SourceCred demo

[![Build Status](https://drone.sfosc.robin-it.com/api/badges/Beanow/sfosc-sourcecred-demo/status.svg)](https://drone.sfosc.robin-it.com/Beanow/sfosc-sourcecred-demo)
[![SourceCred prototype](https://badgen.net/badge/SourceCred/prototype](https://beanow.github.io/sfosc-sourcecred-demo/prototype/)

Currently using a fork from SourceCred's master branch.
See https://github.com/Beanow/sourcecred/tree/hack/weight-overrides

## Configuration notes

The deployment SSH key will also need read-access to any repository it needs to load data from.
This because SourceCred loads over SSH not HTTP.
